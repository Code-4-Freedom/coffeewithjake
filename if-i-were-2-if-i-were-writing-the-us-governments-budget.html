These divisions are crucial to the defense and security of the nation and its freedoms. These would receive a fixed monthly budget.</p><p>Transitional: Department of Education, social programs, Environmental Protection, and utilizes. These are currently dependent on federal funding and management. The goal of this transitional budget would be to slowly reduce the budgets down to $0 while state/local and businesses move in to fill the void.</p><p>This plan would be the lead up to reducing the overall tax rate on Americans and reduce the national debt. Of course this would not be an instant fix, but it would be a good start to slimming down the national debt. In order to eliminate the debt, we first have to stop the spending on services that could be provided by local governments, businesses, or organizations.</p><div><center><embed height="400px" src="https://source.borgcreative.com/bct/mk4-ad-pane-2.html"></center></div></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on September 30, 2021</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://www.coffeewithjake.com/tags/hypothetical/">Hypothetical</a></li><li><a href="https://www.coffeewithjake.com/tags/if-i-were-in-politics/">If I were in politics</a></li><li><a href="https://www.coffeewithjake.com/tags/if-i-were/">If I were...</a></li><li><a href="https://www.coffeewithjake.com/tags/opinion/">Opinion</a></li><li><a href="https://www.coffeewithjake.com/tags/politics/">Politics</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://www.coffeewithjake.com/authors/jake/" class="invert" rel="author">Jake</a></h3><p>I am a Christian, small-business owner, and biology student.</p></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://www.coffeewithjake.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://www.coffeewithjake.com/wow.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> WOW!</a></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Built with <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p><p><a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/coffeewithjake" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img style="height: 60px !important; width: 217px !important;" src="https://cdn.buymeacoffee.com/buttons/v2/default-yellow.png" alt="Buy Me A Coffee"></a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://www.coffeewithjake.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
