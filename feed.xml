      Gettr has been "quietly" released on the Apple and Google Play stores.
    </h2>

  <p>
    I say "quietly" because so many media sites have reported on it. Gettr is a new, unbiased social networking created by Jason Miller, a former adviser to former president Trump. Gettr operates like twitter and has a vibe similar to Minds. Gettr is definitely different from Parler and I believe you should check it out!&nbsp;

  <p>
    Facebook has begun warning users when the platform believes they have been exposed to an "extremist" or to "harmful content" and encourages users to "get support."

    </figure>

  <p>
    Throughout the Bible, we can see time and time again people sinning. In many of the accounts of sin in the Bible there is a common factor: doubt. In Genesis 3, the serpent plants a seed of doubt and makes Eve question what God said about the tree in the middle of the garden ("Genesis 3"). In the book of Exodus, we can see another example of doubt caused sin. In Exodus 32, the people lose faith and begin to question God and His plan ("Exodus 32").

    <h5 id="what-can-we-do-about-our-doubt">
      "What can we do about our doubt?"
    </h5>

  <p>
    The Bible provides an answer to doubt: faith.

      <blockquote>Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.</blockquote>

    <figure class="blockquote">
      <blockquote>Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.</blockquote>
      <figcaption>Philippians 4:6</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h5 id="conclusion">
      Conclusion:
    </h5>

  <p>
    We cannot prevent doubt, but we can prevent it from getting the best of us. When we begin to doubt, we need to have faith in God and pray.
