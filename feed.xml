    Last year, conservatives said, "first its mask mandates, then its vacc1ne mandates," and the left called us crazy. Well, not the Biden administration is trying to impose $17,000 fines on businesses with more than a hundred employees that don't enforce his vacc1ne mandate or have WEEKLY C0VID-19 testing.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are several issues with this.&nbsp;
  </p>
<div><center><embed height="400px" src="https://source.borgcreative.com/bct/mk4-ad-pane-1.html"></center></div>

  <p>
    First, what happened to "my body, my choice?" Because it seems that it is only my choice for what happens to my body until it comes to vacc1nes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Second, businesses are NOT law enforcement. Thus, it is not their job to enforce a mandate, which does not even have the same impact as a law.
  </p>

  <p>
    Third, as a mandate, it cannot act like a law. If the Biden administration really want this to fly, they will have to make a law through the correct channel: Congress.
  </p>

    If I were to write the budget, I would have two primary funding groups: defense and transitional.&nbsp;

    <h4 id="but-what-do-these-groups-include">
      But, what do these groups include?
    </h4>

  <p>
    Defense: DOD, National Parks, FBI, CIA, Secret Service,&nbsp; CBP, Treasury Department, USPS, The Supreme Court, and the Capitol Police. These divisions are crucial to the defense and security of the nation and its freedoms. These would receive a fixed monthly budget.
  </p>

  <p>
    Transitional: Department of Education, social programs, Environmental Protection, and utilizes. These are currently dependent on federal funding and management. The goal of this transitional budget would be to slowly reduce the budgets down to $0 while state/local and businesses move in to fill the void.
  </p>

  <p>
    This plan would be the lead up to reducing the overall tax rate on Americans and reduce the national debt. Of course this would not be an instant fix, but it would be a good start to slimming down the national debt. In order to eliminate the debt, we first have to stop the spending on services that could be provided by local governments, businesses, or organizations.

    Today marks Biden's six month anniversary of becoming president.
  </p>

  <p>
    So far, he and his administration have attacked free speech, taken the credit for operation Warp Speed (One of Trump's biggest projects), made inflation even worse, and failed to find a solution for the southern border.

      The Attack on Free Speech
    </h2>

  <p>
    Just last week, Psaki announced that the White House was consulting with Facebook to flag posts as "misinformation."
  </p>

    <figure class="blockquote">
      <blockquote>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</blockquote>
      <figcaption>U.S. Constitution, First Amendment </figcaption>
    </figure>

  <p>
    
  </p>

  <p>
    While the government has not made a law to abridge free speech when it comes to social media, by the government working with Facebook to censor people, it does abridge free speech. It is the government declaring what you can or can't say, but instead of creating a law, they are using Facebook as a pawn. This makes Facebook an extension of the government.

      Biden's Inflation
    </h2>

  <p>
    The current inflation is largely caused by many of the COVID-19 programs, shipping issues, and government policy. In other words, you cannot blame any single person or party for it. However, we can question why the people in public office are not doing much about it.
  </p>

  <p>
    When the dollar loses value, the numeric price of items goes up, then the minimum wage is jacked up to accommodate, then as business have to pay more, the prices go up again. This all makes the dollar less and less valuable. For example, people use to be able to buy a new car $500. Now to buy a new car, you will be paying minimum $10,000.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    This just shows how much inflation can impact prices.&nbsp;

  </p>

    <h2 id="the-border">
      The Border
    </h2>

  <p>
    The southern border has had problems for years, so it is not Biden's fault that problem exists. However, it is his problem for aggravating the issue by trying to stop the enforcement of the law.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    Trump tried to fix the problems with a wall, but he saw constant push back and to be honest, a wall is not going to fix the problem entirely.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have looked into the whole immigration process to the U.S. and it is garbage. Many of these people coming to the U.S. illegally I honestly don't even blame anymore. It can take years to get approval to move to the U.S., and some people can't wait that long. They are either going to get killed or starve if they wait years.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    If we really want to fix the problem, we need to streamline the entire process of immigration and make it "easier" (Easier as in easier to make the request and get a reply sooner) to get approval to come here. One way I think this could be done is by creating an automated, online system that lets people find out if they are even eligible to come here or make an asylum claim.
  </p>

  <p>
    This way, people could start their applications while in other countries if they don't have a nearby U.S. embassy. All they would have to do is message the automated system on a platform like Signal or other another censorship resistant platform and begin the process. While the entire process could not be completed this way, it would allow the process to start sooner and thus be done sooner.

    If I were in politics...
  </p>

  <p>
    Hypothetically, if I was the governor of California*.
  </p>

  <p>
    I would have prioritized hospital preparedness over vaccination encouragement.
  </p>

  <p>
    What I mean by hospital preparedness is insuring that the hospitals had enough of the needed resources to treat individuals with COVID-19 like Hydroxycholoquine and ventilators.&nbsp;Hydroxycholoquine costs (on average) $148.95 (retail) and ventilators cost between $20,000 and $50,000 (For this post we are just going to assume an average cost of $35,000).&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    Let's say the money spent on the vaccine lottery and given to illegal immigrants was spent on hospital resources, that would give us a budget of approximately $191,000,000. With this money, we could purchase 1,275,595 doses of&nbsp;Hydroxycholoquine with $1,000,000 devoted to delivery costs or 5,428 ventilators (Once again with a $1,000,000 budget for delivering the units). The money could also be split between the two.&nbsp;
  </p>

  <p>
    However, the point is that the money spent illegally on people who are not here legally and on a lottery could have been spent in better ways to help provide better treatment for the people of California and be prepared for any future flare ups of the disease. With any disease, there are flare ups, or hills and valleys. Being prepared for the next hill should be a priority, and a vaccine does not do not. The vaccine has been proven to not protect the vaccinated from contacting the disease post receiving the vaccine, that and it is not FDA approved. The government should not encourage the use of a drug that is not FDA approved.

    </figure>

  <p>
    Throughout the Bible, we can see time and time again people sinning. In many of the accounts of sin in the Bible there is a common factor: doubt. In Genesis 3, the serpent plants a seed of doubt and makes Eve question what God said about the tree in the middle of the garden ("Genesis 3"). In the book of Exodus, we can see another example of doubt caused sin. In Exodus 32, the people lose faith and begin to question God and His plan ("Exodus 32").

    We cannot prevent doubt, but we can prevent it from getting the best of us. When we begin to doubt, we need to have faith in God and pray.
