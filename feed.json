With this money, we could purchase 1,275,595 doses of&nbsp;Hydroxycholoquine with $1,000,000 devoted to delivery costs or 5,428 ventilators (Once again with a $1,000,000 budget for delivering the units). The money could also be split between the two.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    However, the point is that the money spent illegally on people who are not here legally and on a lottery could have been spent in better ways to help provide better treatment for the people of California and be prepared for any future flare ups of the disease. With any disease, there are flare ups, or hills and valleys. Being prepared for the next hill should be a priority, and a vaccine does not do not. The vaccine has been proven to not protect the vaccinated from contacting the disease post receiving the vaccine, that and it is not FDA approved. The government should not encourage the use of a drug that is not FDA approved.\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"sources\">\n      Sources:\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    What is a ventilator?

In many of the accounts of sin in the Bible there is a common factor: doubt.
