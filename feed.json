This makes Facebook an extension of the government.\n  </p>\n\n    <h5 id=\"more-on-free-speech\">\n      More on free speech\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    Foxnews:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/critics-slam-psaki-white-houseconsulting-facebook-flag-misinformation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><em><u>Critics slam the White House after Psaki reveals it's consulting with Facebook to 'flag misinformation'</u></em></a>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Foxnews:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/twitter-psaki-big-tech-unite-bans-misinformation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><em><u>Twitter explodes after Psaki urges Big Tech to unite on bans for 'misinformation' spreaders</u></em></a>\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Foxnews:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/hawley-white-house-facebook-censor-covid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><u><em>Hawley hammers White House as ‘really scary’ for pushing Facebook to 'censor' COVID posts</em></u></a>\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"bidens-inflation\">\n      Biden's Inflation\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    The current inflation is largely caused by many of the COVID-19 programs, shipping issues, and government policy. In other words, you cannot blame any single person or party for it. However, we can question why the people in public office are not doing much about it.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    When the dollar loses value, the numeric price of items goes up, then the minimum wage is jacked up to accommodate, then as business have to pay more, the prices go up again. This all makes the dollar less and less valuable. For example, people use to be able to buy a new car $500. Now to buy a new car, you will be paying minimum $10,000.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    This just shows how much inflation can impact prices.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n    <h5 id=\"more-on-inflation\">\n      More on inflation\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    Breitbart:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2021/07/18/cbss-schlesinger-if-you-account-for-inflation-wages-are-down-1-7-from-last-year/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><em><u>CBS’s Schlesinger: If You Account for Inflation, Wages Are Down 1.7% from Last Year</u></em></a>\n  </p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"the-border\">\n      The Border\n    </h2>\n\n  <p>\n    The southern border has had problems for years, so it is not Biden's fault that problem exists. However, it is his problem for aggravating the issue by trying to stop the enforcement of the law.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    Trump tried to fix the problems with a wall, but he saw constant push back and to be honest, a wall is not going to fix the problem entirely.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    I have looked into the whole immigration process to the U.S. and it is garbage. Many of these people coming to the U.S. illegally I honestly don't even blame anymore. It can take years to get approval to move to the U.S., and some people can't wait that long. They are either going to get killed or starve if they wait years.&nbsp;\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    If we really want to fix the problem, we need to streamline the entire process of immigration and make it \"easier\" (Easier as in easier to make the request and get a reply sooner) to get approval to come here. One way I think this could be done is by creating an automated, online system that lets people find out if they are even eligible to come here or make an asylum claim.\n  </p>\n\n  <p>\n    This way, people could start their applications while in other countries if they don't have a nearby U.S. embassy. All they would have to do is message the automated system on a platform like Signal or other another censorship resistant platform and begin the process. While the entire process could not be completed this way, it would allow the process to start sooner and thus be done sooner.\n  </p>\n\n    <h5 id=\"more-on-the-southern-border\">\n      More on the southern border\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    Breitbart:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2021/07/20/gop-rep-green-governors-have-got-to-push-back-against-biden-immigration-policy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><em><u>GOP Rep.
