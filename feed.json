In many of the accounts of sin in the Bible there is a common factor: doubt. In Genesis 3, the serpent plants a seed of doubt and makes Eve question what God said about the tree in the middle of the garden (\"Genesis 3\"). In the book of Exodus, we can see another example of doubt caused sin. In Exodus 32, the people lose faith and begin to question God and His plan (\"Exodus 32\").\n  </p>\n\n    <h5 id=\"what-can-we-do-about-our-doubt\">\n      \"What can we do about our doubt?\"\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    The Bible provides an answer to doubt: faith.\n  </p>\n\n    <figure class=\"blockquote\">\n      <blockquote>Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you.</blockquote>\n      <figcaption>1 Peter 5:7 NIV</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <figure class=\"blockquote\">\n      <blockquote>Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God.</blockquote>\n      <figcaption>Philippians 4:6</figcaption>\n    </figure>\n\n    <h5 id=\"conclusion\">\n      Conclusion:\n    </h5>\n\n  <p>\n    We cannot prevent doubt, but we can prevent it from getting the best of us.
